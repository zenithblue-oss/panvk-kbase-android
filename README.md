## About

A standalone patch and build layer around pinned upstream Mesa. It produces an
open Mesa PanVK driver that talks directly to Android's proprietary
`mali_kbase` kernel interface (`/dev/mali0`).

It is **not** a Samba-specific or Winlator-specific fork: one driver
source/patch stack, with adapter packages around it.

**Primary consumers**

| # | Consumer | Integration |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Samba S3** | Android/Bionic, in-process custom Vulkan driver |
| 2 | **Bachata S4** | ARM64 glibc Vulkan ICD inside the managed runtime |
| 3 | **NativeCode AI** | ARM64 glibc PRoot validation and development |

**Secondary** (only once the primary driver is correct): Winlator or
AdrenoTools-style loaders, GameHub or component injectors, and other Android
apps that can load an alternate Vulkan ICD.

## Apps

| | App | What it is | Download |

## Tested devices

The latest release is **beta.18 RC1** (release candidate). All rows marked
2026-10-07 used the test build `beta.18-dev+combined` (BuildID `4eab4565`),
with PanProbe 1.2.4-dev (37 tests) and the PanPlay D3D11 cube. It has the
same code as beta.18 RC1; only the `driverInfo` label differs. The G615 row
was rechecked with the RC1 APKs. The series goes up to csf-v11/180:

- BCn emulation rework (150, 151, 180): BC textures are decoded by a fragment
  pass into a compact AFBC/AFRC shadow. Sampling that is limited by bandwidth
  is about 2x faster, and the shadows use 38-65% less memory.
- Shader compile stalls (152-154, 160-164): faster Bifrost register
  allocation. Need for Speed: Most Wanted shaders went from 3.6 s to about
  0.3 s.
- Mesa disk shader cache on by default on Android (170), a PanPlay cache
  path and `dxvk.trackPipelineLifetime = False`.
- Each Android property is looked up only once (171).
- PanPlay keyboard input fix.

On the motorola edge 40 neo, kbase rejects `MEM_ALLOC_EX` with `ENOTTY`, and
the `MEM_ALLOC` fallback from patch 110 works. More tester data (88 records
from 19 devices, up to beta.15) is in
[`docs/universal/DEVICES.md`](docs/universal/DEVICES.md).

### Status per arch

| Arch | Frontend | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| v9 | JM | **Experimental, partly broken** | G57 MC2 only: 2/17 real PanProbe passes, Vulkan 1.1. G77 (`0x90800011`) is not in the Mesa model table, so it shows no GPU |
| v10 | CSF | Works on beta.18 RC1 | G610 MC3 and G710 MC7 pass 37/37. G710 needs the model row from csf-v11/140, so beta.17 does not recognise it |
| v11 | CSF | **Release target**; works on beta.18 RC1 | G615 MC6 (reference) and G715 MC7 (Pixel 8) pass 37/37 |
| v12 | CSF | Works on beta.18 RC1 | Immortalis-G720 MC12 passes 37/37. The G720 MC8 user report has an intermittent `gs_viewport_depth` failure on beta.17 (open, untested on beta.18) |
| v13 | CSF | Works on beta.18 RC1 | Immortalis-G925 MC12 passes 37/37 (beta.17: 34/36) |
| v14 | CSF | **Built, untested** | G1-Ultra (`0xe8800010`) matches its model row, but `vkCreateDevice` failed on beta.15 (`MEM_ALLOC_EX` `ENOTTY`). The 110 fallback is not yet tested on v14 |

### Known gaps

- **Missing gpu_id rows:** Mesa has no row for the G77 (`PAN_PROD_ID(9, 0, 0)`).
  G510, G620, G625 and plain G725 have never been seen, so their gpu_id values
  are unconfirmed. The G710 row only exists from csf-v11/140 (beta.18 RC1).
- **v14:** G1-Ultra needs a rerun with beta.17 or later to check the
  `MEM_ALLOC_EX` fallback.
- **G720 MC8:** intermittent `gs_viewport_depth` failure (PROGRESS item 40,
  not started).

## Supported GPUs

The **Mali-G615** (Mesa `PAN_ARCH` v11, CSF frontend; Arm's 4th generation
Valhall, announced 2022) on the reference device above is the validated
release target. G610 and G710 (v10), G715 (v11), Immortalis-G720 (v12) and
Immortalis-G925 (v13) pass PanProbe 37/37 on the beta.18 build released as
beta.18 RC1 (see [Tested devices](#tested-devices)). v9 JM is
experimental and partly broken; the other parts are untested. Arm's marketing generations (Utgard, Midgard,
Bifrost, Valhall 1st to 4th gen, 5th Gen, G1) and Mesa `PAN_ARCH` numbers are
different schemes; the full chronological GPU list, mappings, frontends and
upstream driver status are in
[`docs/MALI-GPU-ARCHITECTURES.md`](docs/MALI-GPU-ARCHITECTURES.md).

Status key:
- ✅ **Supported**: validated on a device.
- 🧪 **Tested on beta.18**: PanProbe 37/37 and the D3D11 cube on a device with the beta.18 build (released as beta.18 RC1); less coverage than the G615.
- ⚠️ **Tested, known issue**: run on a device by us or a user; works, but with an open issue.
- 🔨 **Built, untested**: compiled into the universal ICD and recognised by the Mesa model table, but never run on that GPU.
- 📋 **TODO**: a profile exists in `profiles/` and the port is planned.
- ❔ **Possible, not tried**: Mesa has a backend for this arch, but no profile or device test exists here.
- ❌ **Not possible**: no PanVK (Vulkan) backend exists for the arch.

One row per Mesa arch. Each GPU carries its own status mark.

| Mesa arch | Arm family / generation | Frontend | GPUs (status per GPU) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| n/a | Pre-Utgard (fixed function) | n/a | ❌ Mali-55, ❌ Mali-110 | No programmable shaders |
| n/a (Lima) | Utgard | n/a | ❌ Mali-200, ❌ Mali-300, ❌ Mali-400 MP, ❌ Mali-450 MP, ❌ Mali-470 MP | GLES 2 only (Lima), no Vulkan |
| v4 | Midgard 1st to 3rd gen | JM | ❌ Mali-T604, ❌ T658, ❌ T622, ❌ T624, ❌ T628, ❌ T678, ❌ T720 | No PanVK backend |
| v5 | Midgard 3rd/4th gen | JM | ❌ Mali-T760, ❌ T820, ❌ T830, ❌ T860, ❌ T880 | No PanVK backend |
| v6 | Bifrost 1st/2nd gen | JM | ❌ Mali-G71, ❔ G72 | Mesa marks G71 unsupported; G72 experimental upstream |
| v7 | Bifrost 1st to 3rd gen | JM | 📋 Mali-G52, ❔ G31, ❔ G51, ❔ G76 | Profile `g52-v7-jm` (P25); needs the JM kbase path |
| v9 | Valhall 1st/2nd gen | JM | 🔨 Mali-G57 (tested, MC2), ❔ G77, ❔ G68, ❔ G78, ❔ G78AE | **EXPERIMENTAL, partly broken** (beta.14 universal ICD). Tested only on a G57 MC2 tablet: CTS smoke subsets mostly pass, PanProbe 1/17, reports Vulkan 1.1 with fewer extensions than v10+ |
| v10 | Valhall 3rd gen | CSF | 🧪 Mali-G610, 🧪 G710, 🔨 G310, ❔ G510 | G610 MC3 (motorola edge 40 neo) and G710 MC7 (Pixel 7) pass PanProbe 37/37 on beta.18-dev (Firebase Test Lab, 2026-10-07). G710 gets its model row in csf-v11/140 (beta.18 RC1). G310 is built, untested; G510 needs a tester's gpu_id |
| **v11** | **Valhall 4th gen** | **CSF** | ✅ **Mali-G615**, 🧪 G715, ❔ Immortalis-G715 | G615 validated on Poco X6 Pro (Dimensity 8300). G715 MC7 (Pixel 8) passes PanProbe 37/37 on beta.18-dev. Immortalis-G715 is untested |
| v12 | 5th Gen | CSF | 🧪 Immortalis-G720, ⚠️ Mali-G720 (MC8, user report), ❔ G620 | Immortalis-G720 MC12 (Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra) passes PanProbe 36/36 on beta.17 and 37/37 on beta.18-dev. beta.18 names it by core count (131). A user's G720 MC8 scores 35-36/37 on beta.17 (intermittent `gs_viewport_depth`, open). G620 is built, untested |
| v13 | 5th Gen | CSF | 🧪 Immortalis-G925, 🔨 Mali-G725, 🔨 G625 | Immortalis-G925 MC12 (Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra) passes PanProbe 37/37 on beta.18-dev (beta.17: 34/36, fixed by 130 and 132). G725 and G625 share the product id and are built, untested |
| v14 | 5th Gen, G1 series | CSF | 🔨 Mali G1-Ultra, 🔨 G1-Premium, 🔨 G1-Pro | **Built, untested** (beta.13 universal ICD). All three are in the Mesa model table; experimental upstream |
| v15 (unconfirmed) | G2 series | CSF | ❌ Mali G2-Ultra NX, ❌ G2-Premium NX (rumoured), ❌ G2-Pro NX (rumoured) | Not in Mesa yet |

"Possible" means Mesa has code for the arch. It does not mean the arch works
here: each one still needs a kbase profile, its kbase frontend path (JM or
CSF) and device validation. The JM parts (v6, v7, v9) also need the
job-manager kbase path, because the current driver uses CSF only.

## Quick start (Poco X6 Pro)

See `docs/BUILD-POCO-X6-PRO.md`.

```sh
./scripts/fetch-mesa.sh
./scripts/apply-patches.sh --profile g615-v11-csf
./scripts/build-android.sh --profile g615-v11-csf

## Release policy

Tiers: `dev` (build only) < `alpha` (compute/offscreen) < `beta` (WSI +
app-loader on one profile) < `rc` (primary consumer) < `stable` (multi-device
+ soak). First Poco build is never `stable`. Releases are immutable; a patch
change creates a new release even if the Mesa SHA is unchanged.

### Current status

Latest: **[`g615-v11-csf-v0.1.0-beta.18-rc1`](https://github.com/zenithblue-oss/panvk-kbase-android/releases/tag/g615-v11-csf-v0.1.0-beta.18-rc1)**
(release candidate, Mesa `5a07217f` plus the committed series up to 180 and `jm-v9`). Each
release ships the Android and glibc drivers, an `.adpkg` package, an EMULATOR
zip, the test APK and screenshots. Full history: [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

| Release | Highlights |
|---|---|
| **beta.18 RC1** | First release tested on v10, v11, v12 and v13 hardware: PanProbe 37/37 on G610, G710, G615, G715, Immortalis-G720 and Immortalis-G925. BCn rework: BC textures decode into a compact tiled AFBC/AFRC shadow, about 2x faster bandwidth-bound sampling and 38-65% less shadow memory (150, 151, 180; AFRC is lossy, `PANVK_BC_AFRC=0` for exact). Shader compile stalls: faster register allocation, NFS: Most Wanted pipelines 3.6 s to about 0.3 s, identical output (152-154, 160-164). Mesa disk shader cache on by default on Android (170), each Android property looked up once (171). `robustBufferAccess2` on v10 (122), v13 vertex stores (130, 132), core-count GPU names (131), G710 model row (140). Known: G720 MC8 `gs_viewport_depth` intermittent (untested on beta.18), v14 untested. |
| **beta.17** | Correctness and reach. G615: GS draws with primitive restart no longer fault the GPU (120); zero depth-range viewports keep exact depth (121); depth bounds keeps FPK/early ZS while off (116); FS `gl_PrimitiveID` survives viewport runs (115); VMR secondaries (114); prerast fan splits (112); `SetEvent`/`ResetEvent` never return DEVICE_LOST (111); X11 software present over MIT-SHM (117). Universal: BC emulation unless all BC formats are native (108), v12+ viewport depth (109), kbase CSF uAPI layouts and 16K pages (110), vertex stores on v13/v14 (119), vendor-neutral gralloc mapper (android/014). PanProbe 36/36 x3; CTS 32339 pass / 115 fail, sync + memory gate unchanged. Fixes for G610/G720/G925/G1-Ultra and stock ROMs untested on hardware. |
| **beta.16** | Removes the remaining CPU waits on the v11 kbase path. Software WSI present no longer blocks the app's submit thread until the GPU finishes the frame (106). Up to three retired tiler heaps can be in flight, so `vkQueueSubmit` no longer stalls 35-55 ms on heap backpressure (107). NFS: Most Wanted race: 85.5 to 90.6 fps (DXVK HUD), p99 frame time 22 to 16 ms. NFS is now limited by Wine, not the GPU. CTS sync + memory gate: same 56 failures; PanProbe 17/17. |
| **beta.15** | Faster kbase submission on v11: no CPU graphics drain on tiler heap renewal (102), same-queue semaphores waited on the GPU (103), next tiler heap created on a worker thread (104). NFS: Most Wanted on G615 goes from 24 to 38-40 fps, p99 frame time 102 to 58 ms, >50 ms frames 650 to ~80. `PANVK_DEBUG=trace` works on kbase again (101, 105). CTS sync + memory: no new failures; PanProbe 17/17. v9 still experimental. Fallout 4 hangs before loading the driver (also on beta.14). |
| **beta.14** | Adds **EXPERIMENTAL, partly broken** Mali v9 (Valhall JM: G57/G68/G77/G78 class) support to the universal ICD (`jm-v9` series: kbase JM atom submission, v9 backend ported from FristOneRR-Panvk-Source, Vulkan 1.1 reporting). Tested only on Mali-G57 MC2: CTS `api.smoke` 4/6, `simple_draw` 4/4, `synchronization.basic` 21 pass/8 not supported, PanProbe 1/17. v10/v12/v13/v14 untested; v11 was tested on beta.13. `driverInfo` reads `PanVK-kbase beta.14`. |
| **beta.13** | One universal Android ICD for v10-v14. **Only v11 (G615) is tested; v10/v12/v13/v14 are built but untested, and testers are needed.** The kbase path now admits v14 without `PAN_I_WANT_A_BROKEN_VULKAN_DRIVER`; v13 was already admitted. Fixes PanProbe `gs_viewport_depth` case A, which regressed in beta.11 (100). On kbase, `gpu_prerast` arenas are committed up front again. GPU-fault growth lost the first GS draw. The shared-TLS memory fix from 097 stays. The kbase CS register-count fallback is now 128 on v12+; 96 was too small. `driverInfo` now reads `PanVK-kbase beta.13 (Mesa 26.3.0-devel ...)`, shown in the DXVK HUD and PanProbe. |
| **beta.12** | One universal Android ICD for v10, v11 and v12. **Only v11 (G615) is tested; v10 and v12 are built but untested, and testers are needed.** The release notes give the command that reports your GPU ID. |
| **beta.11** | Fixes `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` on tiler heap OOM (098). Fixes the memory blow-up from per-pool TLS and eagerly committed prerast arenas (097). |
| **beta.10** | Fast and correct 32-bit WoW64 games: placed maps now map the BO's dma-buf again at the requested address (091) instead of a shadow copy. Need for Speed Most Wanted (DXVK D3D9) went from 0.5 fps to 39-66 fps, with clean HUD and text. Also GPU chunking of large and indirect prerast draws (094, 096), the tessellation conditional-state fix (093), and the sample count for attachment-less secondaries (095). |
| **beta.9** | `depthBounds` (092), `shaderOutputViewportIndex` from VS/TES (090), per-viewport depth clamp/clip (089), CSF event-memory sync words (085). |
| **beta.8** | X11 surfaces (`VK_KHR_xlib_surface`, `VK_KHR_xcb_surface`) for Wine/Proton launchers that display through Termux:X11. The X11/XCB libraries load at runtime from the launcher's library path and are not bundled. Presentation is a software copy (X11 `PutImage`). |

## Capability truth

Two separate sets are stored per release: `UPSTREAM_MATRIX_CAPABILITIES`
(from `docs/features.txt` of the exact Mesa checkout) and
`RUNTIME_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES` (from on-device `vulkaninfo`/probe). Only
runtime-tested capabilities may be used for compatibility claims. No fake
feature bits.

### Phase 5 feature workloads

All 13 target groups are natively exposed and passed real Poco X6 Pro
workloads. Enumeration alone is not counted as a test.

| Feature group | Status | Concise workload evidence |
|---|:---:|---|
| Descriptor indexing | **PASS** | Runtime array, partially-bound and variable-count descriptors; non-uniform sampled-image/storage-buffer indexing; checksum `123` |
| Timeline semaphore | **PASS** | GPU chain `1..64`, CPU wait/signal, CPU-to-GPU wait, final counter `66` |
| Dynamic rendering | **PASS** | `vkCmdBeginRendering`/`vkCmdEndRendering`; 1,154 triangle pixels; checksum `0x9a7f1b8fec90af07` |
| Synchronization2 | **PASS** | `vkCmdPipelineBarrier2` and `vkQueueSubmit2`; timeline completion `67` |
| Buffer device address | **PASS** | Shader dereference at index 3; readback `0x2468ace0` |
| Push descriptors | **PASS** | `vkCmdPushDescriptorSetKHR` storage buffers; readback `0xb791f3dd` |
| Robust buffer access | **PASS** | Out-of-bounds index 64 from one bound uint returned `0x00000000` |
| Anisotropy | **PASS** | 4x anisotropy across 9 sampled formats; two deterministic runs |
| Wide lines | **PASS** | Width 5 rasterized 185 green pixels |

| ASTC HDR | **PASS** | `VK_FORMAT_ASTC_4x4_SFLOAT_BLOCK_EXT`; pixel `[1, 2, 3, 1]`; filtering and mip level 1 |

This table describes the beta.3 release. Since then `textureCompressionBC`
has been exposed on `feature/g615-dxvk-complete` through GPU compute decode
(G615 has no BC hardware); see the DXVK section below. Other unsupported
features are listed in [`docs/RUNTIME-FEATURES.md`](docs/RUNTIME-FEATURES.md).

## DXVK / vkd3d-proton compliance (G615)

### Current state (after csf-v11/092)

DXVK Native v3.1.1 on the Poco X6 Pro creates a D3D11 device at
**feature level 11_0** (`D3D11 HRESULT=0x00000000 feature_level=0xb000`);
D3D11 and D3D9 draw workloads pass. Every feature below runs on the GPU,
with no CPU fallback or simulation, and is exposed only after device proof.

| Feature | Implementation | Device proof (CTS Pass / Fail) |
|---|---|---|
| `geometryShader` | VS/GS run as compute on the GPU pre-raster path, 64 invocations (071) | geometry 193 / 0; instanced 20 / 0 |
| `tessellationShader` | VS, TCS, tessellator and TES as compute, GPU chunking | tessellation 526 / 0 |
| `VK_EXT_transform_feedback` | GPU capture kernel, 4 streams, counters, queries | transform_feedback 15793 / 0 (2 intermittent DeviceLost) |
| `textureCompressionBC` | GPU compute decode of BC1-7 | BC subset 1863 / 0; copy_and_blit 9620 / 0 |
| `shaderClipDistance`, `shaderCullDistance` | NIR lowering | device matrix 0 fail |
| `multiViewport` | 16 viewports, GS viewport index honoured (076) | device matrix 0 fail, scissor 88 / 88 |
| `fillModeNonSolid` | GPU kernel builds line/point primitives | 17/17 pixel-exact |
| `pipelineStatisticsQuery` | 049-054 | statistics_query 15374 / 0 |
| `VK_KHR_incremental_present`, `VK_EXT_swapchain_colorspace`, `VK_EXT_image_compression_control` | upstream backports | device probes 0 fail |
| `VK_EXT_multi_draw` | 072 | multi_draw 12704 / 0 |
| `VK_EXT_primitives_generated_query` | 073 | primitives_generated_query 75206 / 0 |
| `VK_EXT_memory_priority`, `VK_EXT_pageable_device_local_memory` | 069 | 224 / 0, 202 / 0; api.info 7799 / 0 |
| `alphaToOne` | 070 | alphaToOne 123 / 0 |
| `variableMultisampleRate` | 074 | variable_rate 504 / 0 standalone (tmp/cts/p5-vmsr/summary.txt); combined regression run (geometry + tessellation + transform_feedback.simple + variable_rate: 15955 cases, 6210 pass, 9745 NotSupported, 0 fail; source tmp/cts/r6-geo/status.txt) |
| `sync_fd` export | 075 (kbase KCPU queue) | sync_fd 1996 / 0 |
| `vertexPipelineStoresAndAtomics` (v10-v12) | 078-082, vertex stage on the compute pre-raster path | atomic_operations `*_vertex*` 66 / 0; 12132-case tess/geometry/xfb/draw list 7940 / 0, 0 DeviceLost |
| per-viewport depth clamp/clip (beta.9) | 089, GS-selected viewports drawn as ordered runs | panvk-test `gs_viewport_depth` exact (no CTS) |
| `shaderOutputViewportIndex` from VS/TES (beta.9, v10/v11) | 090 | panvk-test `vs_viewport_index` 6/6 (no CTS) |
| `depthBounds` (beta.9, v10/v11) | 092, fragment-shader emulation | 2059 depth-bounds CTS cases: 1774 pass / 0 fail / 285 NotSupported; panvk-test `depth_bounds` 6/6 |

DXVK feature level 11_1 has not been re-checked on the beta.7 to beta.9
builds yet. The Android driver has X11 surfaces (beta.8), but under Proton 11
(i686 through wow64) Wine fails to create the Vulkan surface before the
driver is called, so DXVK presentation there is still blocked. `depthBounds`
lowered pipelines lose FPK, and `EarlyFragmentTests` shaders with depth writes
compare against the fragment's new depth (see the beta.9 release notes).
Still missing: `robustImageAccess2` (the vkd3d-proton device-create
blocker) and
sparse (FL12_0, `NO-GO` on Kbase). The X11 present teardown hang was seen once
under Xvfb only and is unverified on Android. Progress and TODOs:
[`worklogs/g615-dxvk/PROGRESS.md`](worklogs/g615-dxvk/PROGRESS.md). Roadmap:
[`docs/plans/PANVK_MASTER_ROADMAP.md`](docs/plans/PANVK_MASTER_ROADMAP.md).

### beta.3 evaluation (historical)

Machine-evaluated against stock tagged profiles. No fake feature bits.
Overall result: **FAIL**. DXVK 2.7.1/3.1.1 COMMON and vkd3d README hard
gates PASS; D3D9/D3D10/D3D11 profiles and vkd3d 2.14.1/3.0.1 device/profile
baseline FAIL. Stock DXVK/vkd3d smoke is BLOCKED (Android ICD is not a
legal host for those Windows binaries). CTS is BLOCKED.

At beta.3, still false (no spoofing): `geometryShader`, `tessellationShader`,
`fillModeNonSolid`, `multiViewport`, `shaderClipDistance`,
`shaderCullDistance`, `textureCompressionBC`, transform feedback,
`pipelineStatisticsQuery`, `robustImageAccess2`, sparse.

Proven on G615: `VK_EXT_robustness2` buffer + `nullDescriptor`,
`maxPushConstantsSize=256`, `VK_KHR_push_descriptor` / `maxPushDescriptors=32`,
DXVK/vkd3d common easy gates. Advertised UAB limits are 1,048,576; 1M
descriptor stress is implemented but not yet run to completion on device.

At beta.3 the next blocker was `robustImageAccess2` (vkd3d 2.14.1/3.0.1
`DEVICE_CREATE`). It still is; geometry, fill, clip/cull and BC have since
landed (see Current state above).

### New extension workloads

These 16 beta.3 additions are exposed and workload-tested:

`VK_KHR_compute_shader_derivatives`, `VK_KHR_copy_memory_indirect`,
`VK_KHR_internally_synchronized_queues`, `VK_KHR_maintenance7`,
`VK_KHR_maintenance8`, `VK_KHR_maintenance9`, `VK_KHR_present_id2`,
`VK_KHR_present_wait2`, `VK_KHR_shader_constant_data`, `VK_KHR_shader_fma`,
`VK_KHR_shader_relaxed_extended_instruction`,
`VK_KHR_shader_untyped_pointers`, `VK_KHR_surface_maintenance1`,
`VK_KHR_swapchain_maintenance1`, `VK_KHR_unified_image_layouts`, and
`VK_GOOGLE_user_type`.

`VK_KHR_depth_clamp_zero_one`, `VK_KHR_pipeline_binary`, and
`VK_KHR_robustness2` are disabled and not exposed because required workload
proof is absent. `VK_GOOGLE_display_timing` is not exposed without a proven
Android timing implementation.

### beta.2 history

The immutable beta.2 tag exposed 12 instance and 166 device extensions (178
total). Its post-tag documentation commit is distinct from the tagged code as
recorded under [Current status](#current-status). Everything below is the
published beta.3 inventory generated from the canonical matrix.
